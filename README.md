~~A league of legends patch history browser that will potentially never see the light of day~~

# https://resonate.moe

- Only tracks stats, does not track system changes such as sellback price
- Only bugfixes that meaningfully affect gameplay are displayed.
  - Examples of excluded changes: tooltip, visual only, stat tracking, shop-related, lifesteal incorrectly applying to wards
- Hotfixes are displayed as a message inside the parent patch, instead of a separate patch
- Exact formulae for effects such as 'based on missing health' aren't included.
- Though the exact wording of the passives are preserved where sensible, they may also be modified for clarity where appropriate.
- Modern League of Legends blurs the line between items and game systems in jungle & support, where their items function more as role markers than items in the traditional sense. As a general rule, the item history attempts to include only information reasonable for in-game item tooltips, and does not track underlying system changes
  - The jungle pet from S12+ is better considered as part of the role balance and therefore not included.
  - For support items, detailed minion execution mechanics, over-farming penalties, and the anti lane swap system are considered out of scope, despite their existence being dependent on the items.

Items are being added in order listed on wiki. Potions and Consumables, Trinkets, Distributed items will be done last as low priority

Below items have old icons listed, but did not specify when they were updated.
