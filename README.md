A league of legends patch history browser that will potentially never see the light of day

- Only tracks stats, does not track system changes such as sellback price
- Only bugfixes that meaningfully affect gameplay are displayed.
  -- Examples of excluded changes: tooltip, visual only, stat tracking, shop-related, lifesteal incorrectly applying to wards
- Hotfixes are displayed as a message inside the parent patch, instead of a separate patch
- Exact formulae for effects such as 'based on missing health' aren't included.
- Though the exact wording of the passives are preserved where sensible, they may also be modified for clarity where appropriate.
- Modern League of Legends blurs the line between items and game systems in jungle & support, where their items function more as role markers than items in the traditional sense. As a general rule, the item history attempts to include only information reasonable for in-game item tooltips, and does not track underlying system changes
  -- The jungle pet from S12+ is better considered as part of the role balance and therefore not included.
  -- For support items, detailed minion execution mechanics, over-farming penalties, and the anti lane swap system are considered out of scope, despite their existence being dependent on the items.
