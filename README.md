A league of legends patch history browser that will potentially never see the light of day

- Only tracks stats, does not track system changes such as sellback price
- Only bugfixes that meaningfully affect gameplay are displayed. Examples of excluded fixes: tooltip, stat tracking, lifesteal incorrectly applying to wards
- Hotfixes are displayed as a message inside the parent patch, instead of a separate patch
- exact formulae for effects such as 'based on missing health' aren't included. I hope I dont change my mind later and regret it...
